``CameraGeometry.position_to_pix_index`` will now return the minimum integer value for invalid
pixel coordinates instead of -1 due to the danger of using -1 as an index in python accessing
the last element of a data array for invalid pixels.
The function will now also no longer raise an error if the arguments are empty arrays and instead
just return an empty index array.
The function will also no longer log a warning in case of coordinates that do not match a camera pixel.
The function is very low-level and if not finding a pixel at the tested position warrants a warning or
is expected will depend on the calling code.
