Fixed the definition of ``h_max``, which was both inconsistent between
`ctapipe.reco.HillasReconstructor` and `ctapipe.reco.HillasIntersection`
implementations, and was also incorrect since it was measured from the
observatory elevation rather than from sea level.

The value of ``h_max`` is now defined as the height above sea level of the
shower-max point (in meters), not the distance to that point. Therefore it is
not corrected for the zenith angle of the shower. This is consistent with the
options currently used for *CORSIKA*, where the *SLANT* option is set to false,
meaning heights are actual heights not distances from the impact point, and
``x_max`` is a *depth*, not a *slant depth*. Note that this definition may be
inconsistent with other observatories where slant-depths are used, and also note
that the slant depth or distance to shower max are the more useful quantities
for shower physics.
